## Conventions

In this book we'll use a few conventions.

### New Concepts

As many of the topics discussed in this book are a mix of **established** math and physics,  **proposed** dualistic interpretations of established ideas, and also **speculative** ideas that I don't yet know how to address, I wanted a way to clearly distinguish these concepts. I've come up with the following convention to highlight these classes of concepts to indicate their level of mainstream acceptance.

In this book, established concept may be highlighted in green, and represent mainstream physics or math concepts.

> [!established] Established Concept
> Einsteins Relativistic Dynamics Equations
> $$E^2 = (m_{0} \cdot c^2)^2 + (p \cdot c)^2 $$

New ideas proposed by the author which have not been peer reviewed, verified or tested, and should be looked at with scrutiny.

> [!proposed] Proposed Concept
With the speed of light, $c = 1$:
$$E^2 = m_{0}^2 + p^2 $$

Speculative Idea, that the author wonders about, but does not know how to demonstrate, or ideas that need further treatment to prove or disprove.

> [!speculative] Speculative Concept
With the speed of light, $c = 1$:
$$E^2 = m_{0}^2 + p^2 $$

Or Warnings...

> [!caution] Caution Note
> Beware of this section.

> [!warning] Warning Note
> Beware of this section.

> [!danger] Alerts
> Extreme Highlight
